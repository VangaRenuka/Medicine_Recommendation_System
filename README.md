# Medicine_Recommendation_System
The Health Recommendation System is an AI-driven solution designed to provide precautionary advice, health tips, exercises, and diet recommendations based on user-reported symptoms. Unlike traditional medical systems, this project does not recommend medicines but focuses on preventive care and well-being.
